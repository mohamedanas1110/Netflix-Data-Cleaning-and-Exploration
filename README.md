# Netflix-Data-Cleaning-and-Exploration


Analyzing the data and generating insights that could help Netflix in deciding which type of shows/movies to produce and how they can grow the business in different countries

Prepared the data for analysis by performing hefty data cleaning operations such as dealing with NaNs, outliers treatment and unnesting various columns.

Executed EDA, non-graphical analysis, visual analysis of both bivariate and univariate type, plotting different graphs for continuous and categorical variables and for checking correlation between variables.

Generated insights that could help a leading streaming platform in deciding which type of movies/shows to produce and how they can grow the business in different countries.

Observed that the preferred average duration of movies is around 2 hours. Also noticed a high difference between no. of tv shows and no. of movies produced even in high content producing countries.
